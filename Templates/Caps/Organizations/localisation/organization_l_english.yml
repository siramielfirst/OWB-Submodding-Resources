Multiple parties have reported being smoked out, tied up, and blinded by a 'radiant blue light.' Though they didn't harm our scavengers, it seems like our presence is not welcome near these areas. We've not yet been able to make contact with them, until now. A representative returned with one of our scouting groups. Fully covered in a form fitting suit of advanced polymers, they delivered a simple message. 'We are the Koover Mavens, and we have a proposition for you. Help us extract §cOld World Relics§! from the ruins in your territory. We will reward you for your compliance.'

Today, however, a new representative has arrived. One that claims to be more permenant. They tell us that soon, the Mavens will need our assistance, and with assistance comes reward. Before these details are revealed, they've asked us to create an agency to support their efforts throughout the region. We believe this agency could give us an upper hand against our enemies as well."
